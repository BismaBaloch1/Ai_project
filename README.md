# Ai_project
HexAI is a strategic AI-based implementation of the classic board game Hex, allowing gameplay between human players and artificial intelligence agents. The AI supports multiple strategies including Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and Reinforcement Learning. This project was developed as part of an academic exploration into advanced AI decision-making for deterministic, zero-sum board games.

| `-t`, `--use_tt` | Use transposition table     | `bool`                        | `False` |
| `-b`, `--begin`| Which player starts (1 or 2)  | `1 = Blue`, `2 = Red`         | `1`     |

example
python hexai.py -p1 alphabeta -p2 mcts -s 5 -t -b 2

##Experiments: 
Run experiments to compare different AI strategies and heuristics:

1. Alpha-Beta with/without Heuristics

python hexexperiments.py comp -o base -m

2. Iterative Deepening + Transposition Table

   python hexexperiments.py comp -o idtt -m

3.MCTS Optimization

python hexexperiments.py mcts

 ## AI Techniques Used
Minimax Algorithm: Standard decision-making for 2-player adversarial games.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Efficiently reduces the search space in Minimax.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Uses simulation-based strategies for move evaluation.

Reinforcement Learning (optional): Allows AI to improve over time via self-play.

Heuristics: Includes influence maps, shortest path evaluations (Dijkstra), and positional scoring.

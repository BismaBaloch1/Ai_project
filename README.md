# Ai_project
HexAI is a strategic AI-based implementation of the classic board game Hex, allowing gameplay between human players and artificial intelligence agents. The AI supports multiple strategies including Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and Reinforcement Learning. This project was developed as part of an academic exploration into advanced AI decision-making for deterministic, zero-sum board games.
